# Soundtrack v0.13

1. Implemented multitrack midi playback (AVAudioEngine + AVAudioUnitSampler + AVAudioSequence)
2. Implemented some intelligent playback control (Time & Beat based)
3. Implemented user static tracking
4. Allowed play in background (I noticed that midi isn't runing as smooth as in foregound, luckily, all the intelligent controlling worked in background)
5. Get a start point for using Apple Map Kit
